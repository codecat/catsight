# Catsight
Process memory viewer inspired by x64dbg.

## Features
* ~~Cross-platform~~ (currently only runs on Linux)
* View memory region mappings of any process
* Browse and scroll through the memory of any process as an address table
* Disassemble code in memory regions and jump between references

## What this isn't
This is not a debugger. (At least, not yet.) It was not designed with debugging in mind, it is merely a process memory viewer.
